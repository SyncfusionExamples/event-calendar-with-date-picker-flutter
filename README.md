# How to integrate Event Calendar (SfCalendar) with date picker (SfDateRangePicker) in Flutter?

A quick-start example to help you to integrate Event Calendar (SfCalendar) with date picker (SfDateRangePicker) in Flutter.

You can customise the Flutter Event Calendar by integrating it with DateRangePicker controls. The Flutter Calendar's Header and ViewHeader are hidden in this example, and the DateRangePicker has been placed instead of the default header. You can move the calendar view using the [onSelectionChanged](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/daterangepicker/callbacks#selection-changed-callback) callback of the Flutter date range picker control, and the picker selection will be applied based on the [onViewChanged](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/calendar/callbacks#view-changed-callback) callback of the Flutter event calendar.
